## [BUGGIFY](buggify.html)

Simulation has built-in support for injecting low-level failures, and thus can
productively discover failures of low-level components.  As lower-level
abstractions are assembled into a higher-level system, simulation will lose
effectiveness in finding high-level failures by injecting low-level bugs.
`BUGGIFY` bridges the gap to allow random injection of abstract, system
component failures.
